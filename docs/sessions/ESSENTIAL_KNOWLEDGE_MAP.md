The ASCII cow aesthetic can bring personality to these concepts while maintaining educational rigor. Start with high-priority terms from beginner clusters, then expand systematically through the domains.

**Next Steps:**
1. Select first 20-30 terms from high-priority list
2. Create scripts following the video structure template
3. Develop ASCII visual style guide for each domain
4. Build cross-reference linking system
5. Track which terms resonate most with audience
6. Expand into adjacent domains based on engagement
