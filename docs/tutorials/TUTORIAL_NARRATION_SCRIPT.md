It's built on *eighteen* mandatory rules, [...]
combining techniques from YouTube educational courses [...]
with cutting-edge research from Meta AI, Microsoft Research, [...]
Stanford University, and Google DeepMind.

[1:18]
The result? [...]
Twenty-three percent *fewer* hallucinations, [...]
*zero* surprises, [...]
and *complete* control over every change.

[1:30]
This isn't just another prompt template. [...]
It's a *complete restructuring* of how AI assistants collaborate with developers.

[1:40]
Let's see it in action.
```

**Voice Direction**: Confident and enthusiastic, emphasize statistics and research institutions

```
[2:35]
First, download the R-P-I Framework Package from GitHub.

[2:41]
You can clone the repository at [SLOW] github dot com slash drewbeyersdorf slash agent-improvement-techniques [/SLOW] [...]
or download the ZIP file directly.

[2:57]
The package includes everything you need: [...]
the installer script, [...]
the framework files, [...]
and comprehensive documentation.

[3:09]
Once downloaded, unzip the package to a convenient location.
```

**Voice Direction**: Spell out URL slowly and clearly

### Scene 3C: Run Installer
**Duration**: 3:20 - 4:50 (90 seconds)

#### Visual Description:
Terminal showing each command being typed. File copying animation. Progress indicators. Success checkmark at end.

#### Narration:

```
[3:20]
Navigate to the R-P-I Framework Package directory in your terminal.

[3:26]
Now, make the installer executable by running: [...]
[SLOW] chmod space plus x space install dash rpi dash framework dot sh [/SLOW]

[3:40]
Then run the installer: [...]
[SLOW] dot slash install dash rpi dash framework dot sh [/SLOW]

[3:51]
You'll see two options.

[3:54]
Option 1 installs the framework *globally* - [...]
it will work for *all* your projects.

[4:01]
Option 2 installs it for just the current project.

[4:05]
For most users, we recommend Option 1, the global install.

[4:10]
Press 1 and hit Enter.

[4:14]
The installer will copy three key files to your dot claude directory: [...]

[4:20]
instructions dot M-D - the main framework file that Claude auto-loads, [...]

[4:27]
ENFORCED underscore RPI underscore PROTOCOL dot M-D - the complete ruleset, [...]

[4:34]
and RPI underscore STATUS dot M-D - for testing and verification.

[4:40]
Installation complete! [...]
Now restart Claude Code to activate the framework.
```

**Voice Direction**: Very deliberate on commands, pause between each file name

#### Narration:

```
[4:50]
Let's verify the installation worked.

[4:53]
Start Claude Code and type: "Add a search feature"

[4:59]
If R-P-I is working, Claude will immediately ask clarifying questions [...]
using T-C-R-E-I validation.

[5:07]
If you see these questions instead of Claude immediately implementing something, [...]
congratulations! The R-P-I Framework is active and working.
```

**Voice Direction**: Excited and celebratory at "congratulations"

#### Narration:

```
[5:15]
Let's walk through a real example. [...]
We'll ask Claude to add user authentication to an existing application.

[5:24]
Without R-P-I, Claude might immediately start implementing something [...]
that doesn't match what you *actually* need.

[5:32]
With R-P-I, here's what happens.
```

**Voice Direction**: Set up contrast between chaos and order

---

### Scene 4B: TCREI Validation

```
[5:45]
You type: "Add user authentication"

[5:49]
Claude immediately enters T-C-R-E-I Validation mode and asks:

[5:55]
"I need to clarify a few things:

[5:58]
Context - Why is authentication needed? Who are the users?

[6:03]
Reference - Are there existing authentication patterns in your codebase?

[6:09]
Evaluation - What defines successful authentication?

[6:13]
Input - Should I read your database schema first?"

[6:18]
This ensures you and Claude are *perfectly aligned* [...]
before any code is written.
```

**Voice Direction**: Read Claude's questions with slight questioning inflection

---

### Scene 4C: Research Phase
**Duration**: 6:30 - 7:30 (60 seconds)

#### Visual Description:
File explorer with files being opened and scanned (magnifying glass animation). Code scrolling. .research.md file appears with verified findings. Confidence bars showing 100%.

#### Narration:

```
[6:30]
After you answer the questions, Claude enters *Research Phase*.

[6:35]
It reads your database schema to understand your data structure. [...]

[6:41]
It checks your existing codebase for similar patterns. [...]

[6:45]
It verifies *every* claim with exact file and line references.

[6:51]
Then it creates a dot research dot M-D file [...]
documenting everything it found, [...]
with confidence scores for each finding.

[7:01]
"Found User table in schema dot T-S line 23 - Confidence: one hundred percent verified.

[7:10]
Found similar OAuth pattern in auth slash social dot T-S line 45 - [...]
Confidence: one hundred percent verified."

[7:19]
Claude then asks: "Please review dot research dot M-D - approve to proceed to planning?"

[7:26]
You're in control. Always.
```

**Voice Direction**: Emphasize "verified" and "you're in control"

---

### Scene 4D: Planning Phase
**Duration**: 7:30 - 8:30 (60 seconds)

#### Visual Description:
.plan.md file being created. Each step appears with time estimate counter. Code snippet previews expand. Confidence gauge shows 85%.

#### Narration:

```
[7:30]
You approve, and Claude enters *Planning Phase*.

[7:35]
It breaks the complex task into atomic steps using M-A-K-E-R decomposition. [...]
Each step is under thirty minutes of work. [...]
Each step includes actual code snippets showing what will be written. [...]
Each step specifies the test command to verify it worked.

[7:52]
"Step 1: Create User model - 20 minutes [...]
 Step 2: Add bcrypt password hashing - 15 minutes [...]
 Step 3: Create login API endpoint - 25 minutes [...]
 Step 4: Add J-W-T token generation - 20 minutes [...]
 Step 5: Create middleware for protected routes - 25 minutes [...]
 Step 6: Write integration tests - 25 minutes"

[8:15]
Overall confidence: eighty-five percent

[8:19]
Then Claude asks: "Approve to implement?"

[8:23]
Again, you're in control before any code is written.
```

**Voice Direction**: Slightly faster for step listing, return to normal for approval

---

### Scene 4E: Implementation Phase
**Duration**: 8:30 - 9:15 (45 seconds)

#### Visual Description:
Code being typed in editor. Terminal shows test commands running with green checkmarks. Progress bar advances (1/6, 2/6, etc.). Error appears briefly, then auto-fixes. .completion-snapshot.md appears at end.

#### Narration:

```
[8:30]
You approve, and Claude begins implementation.

[8:34]
It follows the plan *exactly* - no surprises, no extra features.

[8:40]
After each step, it runs the actual test command [...]
and verifies the exit code is zero. [...]
No assumptions. No "probably works." [...]
Actual verification.

[8:51]
"Step 1 of 6 complete - tests passed, exit code 0 - verified [...]
 Step 2 of 6 complete - tests passed, exit code 0 - verified"

[9:00]
If an error occurs, Claude doesn't bother you - [...]
it autonomously reads the error log, diagnoses the problem, [...]
and fixes it if confidence is above seventy percent.

[9:09]
When all steps are complete, Claude creates a dot completion-snapshot dot M-D [...]
documenting exactly what was done, with verified test results.
```

**Voice Direction**: Confident and reassuring, emphasize "actual verification"
