# TCREI Short - Voice Narration (30 seconds)

[0:00] STOP letting AI guess what you want!

[0:03] Most developers just say "add authentication"
and wonder why AI builds the wrong thing.

[0:08] There's a better way: T-C-R-E-I

[0:11] T - Task: What exactly do you need?

[0:14] C - Context: Why is it needed?

[0:16] R - Reference: Any existing patterns?

[0:19] E - Evaluation: How do you measure success?

[0:22] I - Input: Should AI read your schema first?

[0:25] Result? You and AI are perfectly aligned
before ANY code is written.

[0:28] Try the RPI Framework. Link in bio!
