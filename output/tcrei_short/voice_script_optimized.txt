# TCREI Short - Voice Narration

## Original Script
[0:00] STOP letting AI guess what you want!

[0:03] Most developers just say "add authentication"
and wonder why AI builds the wrong thing.

[0:08] There's a better way: T-C-R-E-I

[0:11] T - Task: What exactly do you need?

[0:14] C - Context: Why is it needed?

[0:16] R - Reference: Any existing patterns?

[0:19] E - Evaluation: How do you measure success?

[0:22] I - Input: Should AI read your schema first?

[0:25] Result? You and AI are perfectly aligned
before ANY code is written.

[0:28] Try the RPI Framework. Link in bio!

## Optimized by Gemini 2.0 Flash
Okay, here's an optimized script, pronunciation guide, emphasis suggestions, and pacing notes designed for a fast-paced, energetic 30-second YouTube Short using text-to-speech.

**Optimized Script:**

[0:00] **DON'T** let AI guess! (Hook - emphasis on "DON'T")

[0:03] Devs say "add auth," get garbage code. (Simplified for speed)

[0:06] There's a **SMARTER** way.  T-C-R-E-I! (Build anticipation)

[0:09] **T**: Task. *Specifically* what do you need?

[0:12] **C**: Context. *Why* is it even necessary?

[0:14] **R**: Reference.  Existing examples to copy?

[0:17] **E**: Evaluation.  How will you measure success?

[0:20] **I**: Input. Should AI see your schema *first*?

[0:23] Aligned goals!  **PERFECT** code, *every* time. (Excitement!)

[0:26] Use the RPI Framework! Link in bio!

[0:29] (Silence - allows for a clean loop)

**Pronunciation Guide:**

*   **T-C-R-E-I:**  "Tee - See - Are - Eee - Eye" (Each letter pronounced individually and clearly)
*   **Auth:** "Awth" (Short 'a' sound)
*   **Schema:** "Skee-mah"
*   **RPI Framework:** "Are - Pee - Eye Framework" (Each letter pronounced individually and clearly)

**Emphasis Suggestions:**

*   **0:00:** **DON'T** (Strong emphasis to grab attention)
*   **0:03:**  "auth," "garbage" (to highlight the problem)
*   **0:06:** **SMARTER** (Contrast and excitement)
*   **0:09-0:20:**  The letter (T, C, R, E, I) at the beginning of each line should be emphasized. Also, emphasize the words: *Specifically*, *Why*, *first*.
*   **0:23:** **PERFECT**, *every* (Build excitement and benefits)

**Pacing Notes:**

*   **0:00-0:06:** Fast-paced and energetic. Almost a rapid-fire delivery.
*   **0:09-0:20:**  Slightly slower pace to allow the listener to process each letter and its meaning.  A distinct pause *after* each letter is spoken (e.g., "T... Task").
*   **0:23-0:26:** Return to the fast-paced, energetic delivery to end on a high note.
*   **0:29:** Silence at the end for looping

**Rationale for Changes:**

*   **Shorter Phrases:**  The original script had some sentences that were too long for a fast-paced short. I broke them down for quicker comprehension.
*   **Simplified Language:** Replaced words like "authentication" with "auth" to save time and create a more casual tone.
*   **Stronger Hooks:**  The opening hook is more direct and attention-grabbing.
*   **Clearer Benefits:**  The script emphasizes the *benefits* of using the TCREI framework (perfect code, aligned goals) more explicitly.
*   **Pacing Variety:** The slight change in pace between the explanation and the introduction/conclusion gives the listener a chance to absorb the information while maintaining a sense of urgency.
*   **Looping:** The silence at the end allows the short to seamlessly loop.

This revised script, with the pronunciation and pacing guidelines, should result in a highly engaging and effective YouTube Short. Good luck!
