## ✅ Option 1: AI Video Generator (Easiest - 5 Minutes)

Use **Invideo AI** to generate the entire video from a text prompt:

### Step 1: Go to Invideo AI
https://invideo.io/ai/

### Step 2: Paste This Exact Prompt:

```
Create a 30-second vertical video (9:16) for YouTube Shorts about TCREI framework.

SCENE 1 (0-3s): Red background, large text "STOP!" with subtitle "letting AI guess what you want!" - urgent, attention-grabbing

SCENE 2 (3-8s): Dark background, show frustrated developer, speech bubble says "Add auth", text "AI builds the WRONG thing ❌"

SCENE 3 (8-11s): Blue gradient background, huge text "TCREI" with sparkle effects, subtitle "Perfect AI Alignment"

SCENE 4 (11-25s): Dark background, show 5 sections vertically:
- T 📋 Task - What exactly?
- C 🎯 Context - Why needed?
- R 🔍 Reference - Any examples?
- E ✅ Evaluation - Measure success?
- I 📊 Input - Read schema first?

SCENE 5 (25-28s): Split screen - top half red "BEFORE ❌ Chaotic", bottom half green "AFTER ✅ Perfect Alignment"

SCENE 6 (28-30s): Blue background, text "RPI Framework" and "Link in bio ⬇️"

Style: Modern, bold, tech-focused, mobile-optimized text (minimum 50pt), high contrast colors

Voice: Female professional, energetic pace

Script: "DON'T let AI guess! Devs say add auth, get garbage code. There's a SMARTER way. T-C-R-E-I! T: Task - what exactly? C: Context - why needed? R: Reference - any examples? E: Evaluation - measure success? I: Input - read schema first? Aligned goals! PERFECT code every time. Use the RPI Framework! Link in bio!"
```

## ✅ Option 3: Runway ML (AI-Powered - 10 Minutes)

Use Runway's Gen-2 to generate video from text:

### Step 1: Go to Runway
https://runwayml.com/

### Step 2: Use "Text to Video"

### Step 3: Create 6 Short Clips:

**Clip 1 - Hook**:
```
Vertical phone screen, red warning background, bold white text "STOP" appearing with shake effect, urgent atmosphere, modern tech aesthetic
```

**Clip 2 - Problem**:
```
Frustrated developer at computer, dark background, speech bubble "Add auth", error symbols appearing, tech office setting, vertical format
```

**Clip 3 - Logo**:
```
Blue gradient background, large letters "TCREI" materializing with sparkle effects, clean professional design, vertical phone screen
```

**Clip 4 - Breakdown**:
```
Dark background with 5 stacked text sections showing T C R E I letters with icons, educational tech video style, vertical format, clean typography
```

**Clip 5 - Result**:
```
Split screen effect, top half red and chaotic, bottom half green and organized, before/after transformation, vertical phone screen
```

**Clip 6 - CTA**:
```
Blue gradient background, text "Link in bio" with down arrow, professional tech branding, vertical format
```

### Step 4: Combine in Runway's Editor

**Time**: 10 minutes
**Cost**: FREE trial
**Quality**: Very high (AI-generated video)

## ✅ Option 4: I Can Create Frame-by-Frame Images (20 Minutes)

I can generate each frame as an image, then you combine with ffmpeg:

### What I'll Do:
1. Generate 180 images (30 seconds × 6 frames/sec)
2. Each image = one frame of the video
3. You run one ffmpeg command to combine

### Command I'll Provide:
```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 6 -i frame_%03d.png -c:v libx264 -pf yuv420p tcrei_short.mp4
```

**Time**: 20 minutes (mostly rendering)
**Cost**: FREE
**Control**: Maximum
