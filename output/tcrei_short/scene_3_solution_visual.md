Okay, here's a detailed visual specification for scene_3_solution (0:08-0:11) of the 30-second vertical video, designed for YouTube Shorts/TikTok/Instagram Reels using Canva Free:

**Scene:** scene_3_solution
**Duration:** 0:08-0:11 (3 seconds)
**Narration:** There's a better way: T-C-R-E-I
**Visual Focus:** TCREI logo reveal with impact
**Style:** Confident, solution introduction

**1. Background**

*   **Color/Gradient:**
    *   **Base:** Linear Gradient.  Start with a dark, sophisticated blue (#1A237E) at the top transitioning to a slightly lighter, brighter blue (#3F51B5) at the bottom.
    *   **Mood/Atmosphere:** Professional, trustworthy, modern, solution-oriented. The gradient provides visual interest without being distracting.

**2. Main Elements**

*   **Text Overlays:**
    *   **Line 1 (0:08-0:09):** "There's a better way:" (Smaller, secondary text)
        *   Size: 36pt
        *   Position: Top Third (slightly below the very top edge)
    *   **Line 2 (0:09-0:11):** "TCREI" (Large, main text - the logo reveal)
        *   Size: 120pt (adjust to fit nicely, making it as large as possible without clipping)
        *   Position: Center (vertically and horizontally)

*   **Characters/Icons:** None

*   **Graphics:**
    *   **Underline:** A thin, bright yellow/gold line (#FFD700) appears *under* "TCREI" at the same time as the text reveals.
        *   Thickness: 4pt
        *   Length: Slightly longer than the width of "TCREI" text.
        *   Position: Aligned with the bottom edge of the "TCREI" text.

**3. Layout**

*   **Element Positioning:**
    *   "There's a better way:" - Top Third
    *   "TCREI" - Center
    *   Underline - Directly below "TCREI"
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    1.  "TCREI" (largest, centered, impactful reveal)
    2.  Underline (highlights "TCREI")
    3.  "There's a better way:" (provides context)

**4. Animations**

*   **"There's a better way:"**
    *   Entry Effect (0:08): Fade In (0.3s duration)
*   **"TCREI":**
    *   Entry Effect (0:09): Scale Up (0.5s duration), starting very small (maybe 20% scale) and expanding to 100%.
    *   During-Scene Animation (0:09-0:11): Subtle Pulse (scale up and down by 5% repeatedly) - VERY subtle.
*   **Underline:**
    *   Entry Effect (0:09):  Wipe In (left to right), simultaneously with "TCREI" appearing.  Set the duration to 0.5s.
*   **Exits:** No explicit exit animations needed. Elements can remain visible until the transition to the next scene.

**5. Typography**

*   **Font Recommendations:**
    *   "There's a better way:": Montserrat (Medium) - Clean, readable, professional.
    *   "TCREI": Bebas Neue (Regular) - Bold, impactful, modern.  This font is crucial for the logo reveal's impact.
*   **Sizes:** (As specified above, but adjust as needed based on the specific font and mobile readability tests.)
*   **Colors and Contrast:**
    *   "There's a better way:": White (#FFFFFF) - Excellent contrast against the dark blue background.
    *   "TCREI": White (#FFFFFF) - Same reason as above.
    *   Underline:  Bright Yellow/Gold (#FFD700) - A contrasting color that makes it stand out.

**Canva Implementation Notes:**

*   **Grouping:**  Group the "TCREI" text and underline after placing and animating them to keep them aligned.
*   **Animation:** Use Canva's animation options on individual elements. Experiment with the "Scale" and "Wipe" effects to achieve the desired impact.
*   **Testing:** Preview the video on a mobile device to ensure readability.  Adjust font sizes as needed.
*   **Timing:** Pay close attention to the timing of each element's entry. The overall effect should be snappy and impactful.

This specification is designed to create a short, visually appealing scene that effectively introduces the "TCREI" concept with a confident and modern style. The animation choices and color palette are intended to capture attention and make the information memorable for mobile viewers.
