## Scene 2: Problem Visualization - Visual Specification (Canva Free)

**Scene:** scene_2_problem
**Duration:** 0:03-0:08
**Narration:** Most developers just say "add authentication" and wonder why AI builds the wrong thing.
**Visual Focus:** Frustrated developer, speech bubble
**Style:** Relatable problem visualization

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Instagram Reels
**Tool:** Canva Free

**1. Background:**

*   **Color/Gradient:** Linear gradient from `#F0F0F0` (light gray) at the top to `#FFFFFF` (white) at the bottom. This provides a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the main elements.
*   **Mood/Atmosphere:** Clean, slightly stressed, reflecting the developer's frustration.

**2. Main Elements:**

*   **Character/Icon:**
    *   Canva Element: Search for "frustrated developer" or "stressed developer" under "Graphics". Choose a cartoon-style character that is expressive and clearly shows frustration (e.g., hands on head, furrowed brow). Ensure the character is facing forward or slightly angled towards the viewer.
    *   Size: Medium-large, taking up approximately 1/3 of the screen height.
    *   Position: Centered vertically and slightly offset to the left of the screen.
*   **Speech Bubble:**
    *   Canva Element: Use a standard oval speech bubble.
    *   Color: `#FFFFFF` (white) with a thin `#000000` (black) border (1-2px width).
    *   Tail: Pointing towards the developer character.
    *   Size: Medium, large enough to contain the text without feeling cramped.
    *   Position: Positioned above and slightly to the right of the developer character.
*   **Text Overlay (Narration):**
    *   **Line 1:** "Most developers"
    *   **Line 2:** "just say" "add authentication""
    *   **Line 3:** "and wonder why AI"
    *   **Line 4:** "builds the wrong thing."
    *   Font: "Poppins Bold" (or similar bold, clean sans-serif font).
    *   Color: `#000000` (black).
    *   Size: Adjust font size to fit neatly within the speech bubble, but no smaller than 24pt.  Prioritize readability.
    *   Position: Centered within the speech bubble.

**3. Layout:**

*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    1.  **Frustrated Developer Character:** This immediately draws the eye and sets the scene.
    2.  **Speech Bubble with Text:**  The speech bubble clearly indicates the developer's thought process and connects to the narration.
*   **Element Positioning:**
    *   Top Third: Mostly clear to avoid obstructing the speaker's face in a reaction video.
    *   Center: Developer character and speech bubble are primarily centered vertically.
    *   Bottom Third: Clear to avoid obstructing any captions or platform UI elements.
*   **Padding:** Ensure sufficient padding around the edges of the screen to prevent elements from being cut off on different devices.

**4. Animations:**

*   **Frustrated Developer Character:**
    *   Entry Effect: "Fade In" (Duration: 0.3 seconds) starting at 0:03.
    *   During-Scene Animation: Subtle "Pulse" animation (Intensity: Low, Speed: Slow) throughout the scene to add a touch of life.
*   **Speech Bubble:**
    *   Entry Effect: "Slide In" from the right (Duration: 0.3 seconds) starting at 0:04, slightly after the character.
*   **Text Overlay:**
    *   Entry Effect: "Fade In" (Duration: 0.3 seconds) starting at 0:04.
    *   During-Scene Animation: None. Keep the text static for easy reading.

**5. Typography:**

*   **Font Recommendations:**
    *   "Poppins Bold" (primary - for the text in speech bubble)
*   **Sizes:**
    *   Text Overlay: 24-32pt (adjust based on length of the text and speech bubble size)
*   **Colors and Contrast:**
    *   Text: `#000000` (black) on `#FFFFFF` (white) background for high contrast and readability.

**Detailed Timing Breakdown:**

*   **0:03 - 0:03.3:** Developer Character fades in.
*   **0:04 - 0:04.3:** Speech Bubble slides in, Text fades in.
*   **0:04 - 0:08:** Developer pulses subtly, narration is displayed in the speech bubble.

**Notes for Canva Creation:**

*   Use the Canva gridlines to ensure elements are properly aligned and centered.
*   Use the "Position" tool to fine-tune the placement of elements.
*   Test the video on a mobile device to ensure readability.
*   Consider adding a subtle sound effect (e.g., a frustrated sigh) to enhance the emotional impact.
