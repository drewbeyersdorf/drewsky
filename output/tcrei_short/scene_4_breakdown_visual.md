## Scene 4: TCREI Breakdown - Visual Specification (0:11-0:25)

**Overall Goal:** Clearly and concisely present the TCREI framework using visuals and animations in a way that is engaging and easily understandable on a mobile device.

**1. Background:**

*   **Color:** Gradient from #6A5ACD (SlateBlue - Top) to #87CEEB (SkyBlue - Bottom). Create this gradient using Canva's background gradient tool.
*   **Mood/Atmosphere:** Clean, professional, and encouraging. The gradient provides a soft, approachable feel, avoiding harshness.

**2. Main Elements (TCREI Breakdown):**

*   **Initial State (0:11-0:12):**
    *   **Text Overlay:** "TCREI" in large, bold font (see Typography) - centered at the top of the screen.
    *   **Supporting Text:** "Breakdown" in a smaller, but still readable font (see Typography) - centered below "TCREI".
*   **Incremental Appearance (0:12 - 0:25):**  Each TCREI element will appear sequentially, with a brief pause between each.
    *   **T - Task (0:12-0:14):**
        *   **Icon:** Canva Element: Search for "checklist icon" - use a filled, solid icon in #FFFFFF (White). Positioned to the left of the text.
        *   **Text Overlay:** "T - Task" in a bold font (see Typography) - positioned below "TCREI Breakdown" and centered.
        *   **Description:** "What exactly do you need?" in a smaller, legible font (see Typography) - positioned below "T - Task" and centered.
    *   **C - Context (0:14-0:16):**
        *   **Icon:** Canva Element: Search for "why icon" - use a solid question mark icon in #FFFFFF (White). Positioned to the left of the text.
        *   **Text Overlay:** "C - Context" in a bold font (see Typography) - positioned below the previous description and centered.
        *   **Description:** "Why is it needed?" in a smaller, legible font (see Typography) - positioned below "C - Context" and centered.
    *   **R - Reference (0:16-0:18):**
        *   **Icon:** Canva Element: Search for "pattern icon" or "reference icon" - use a solid, repeating pattern icon in #FFFFFF (White). Positioned to the left of the text.
        *   **Text Overlay:** "R - Reference" in a bold font (see Typography) - positioned below the previous description and centered.
        *   **Description:** "Any existing patterns?" in a smaller, legible font (see Typography) - positioned below "R - Reference" and centered.
    *   **E - Evaluation (0:18-0:20):**
        *   **Icon:** Canva Element: Search for "bar chart icon" or "measurement icon" - use a solid icon in #FFFFFF (White). Positioned to the left of the text.
        *   **Text Overlay:** "E - Evaluation" in a bold font (see Typography) - positioned below the previous description and centered.
        *   **Description:** "How do you measure success?" in a smaller, legible font (see Typography) - positioned below "E - Evaluation" and centered.
    *   **I - Input (0:20-0:22):**
        *   **Icon:** Canva Element: Search for "AI icon" or "code icon" - use a solid icon in #FFFFFF (White). Positioned to the left of the text.
        *   **Text Overlay:** "I - Input" in a bold font (see Typography) - positioned below the previous description and centered.
        *   **Description:** "Should AI read your schema first?" in a smaller, legible font (see Typography) - positioned below "I - Input" and centered.

**3. Layout:**

*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    1.  "TCREI Breakdown" title to establish the topic.
    2.  Each TCREI element (letter and name) to grab attention.
    3.  The description to provide the specifics.
*   **Element Positioning:** Elements are stacked vertically, centered, and evenly spaced to maximize readability on mobile. Icons are placed to the left of each TCREI letter to provide visual cues.
*   **Top Third:** Reserved for the title.
*   **Center:** The TCREI elements will appear sequentially in the center.
*   **Bottom Third:** Will dynamically fill up as more elements are added.

**4. Animations:**

*   **Entry Effect (TCREI Breakdown Title):** Fade In (0:11)
*   **Entry Effect (Each TCREI Element):** Slide In from the left (icon and letter) and Fade In (description).
*   **During-Scene Animation:**
    *   **Highlight Current Element:** Briefly pulse the background color of the currently displayed TCREI element (behind both the name and the description). The pulse should be subtle - just a slight brightening of the background gradient. This is easily achievable in Canva by duplicating the background, changing the color slightly, and using the animation "Breathe" effect.
*   **Timing:**
    *   "TCREI Breakdown" title appears at 0:11.
    *   "T - Task" appears at 0:12, remains on screen for 2 seconds (0:12-0:14)
    *   "C - Context" appears at 0:14, remains on screen for 2 seconds (0:14-0:16)
    *   "R - Reference" appears at 0:16, remains on screen for 2 seconds (0:16-0:18)
    *   "E - Evaluation" appears at 0:18, remains on screen for 2 seconds (0:18-0:20)
    *   "I - Input" appears at 0:20, remains on screen until the end of the scene (0:20-0:25)

**5. Typography:**

*   **Font Recommendation:**
    *   **Headline (TCREI Breakdown):** "Montserrat ExtraBold"
    *   **TCREI Letters (T - Task, etc.):** "Montserrat Bold"
    *   **Descriptions:** "Montserrat Regular"
*   **Sizes:**
    *   Headline: 48pt
    *   TCREI Letters: 36pt
    *   Descriptions: 24pt
*   **Colors:**
    *   Text: #FFFFFF (White) for maximum contrast against the background.
    *   Use a slight drop shadow (Canva effect) with a very small blur radius to increase readability even further.
