## Canva Vertical Video Guide: Create a Killer 30-Second Short!

**This guide will help you create engaging vertical videos, even if you've never used Canva before!**

**1. Initial Setup: Creating Your Canva Project**

1.  **Go to Canva:** Open your web browser and go to [www.canva.com](www.canva.com).  If you don't have an account, sign up for a free one.

2.  **Create a Design:**  On the Canva homepage, click the "Create a design" button (usually in the upper right corner).

4.  **Enter Dimensions:**  Enter the following dimensions:

    *   Width: `1080`
    *   Height: `1920`
    *   Make sure the unit is set to `px` (pixels).

    Then, click "Create new design."

5.  **Page Structure (6 Scenes):**  Canva will open a blank canvas.  We need 6 pages for our 6 scenes.  Click the "Add page" button (a plus sign inside a square) at the bottom of the screen five times.  You should now have 6 blank pages.

**2. Design Tips for Vertical Video Success**

*   **Safe Zones:**  Vertical videos are often cropped at the top and bottom by platform interfaces (like the YouTube Shorts shelf or TikTok captions).  Avoid placing crucial text or elements in the top 15% and bottom 15% of your canvas. Imagine invisible lines about 15% from the top and bottom. Keep important things *inside* those lines.

*   **Text Sizing:**  Mobile users are watching on small screens.  Use large, bold fonts for maximum readability.  Experiment with different sizes to see what looks best on your phone.  Test by sending a screenshot of your design to yourself and viewing it on your phone.

*   **Element Positioning:** Keep the design clean and uncluttered. Use negative space (empty areas) to draw the eye to key elements.  Consider the flow of information – where do you want the viewer to look first, second, etc.?

**3. Creating Common Elements**

1.  **Text Overlays (Large, Bold):**

    *   Click the "Text" tab on the left sidebar.
    *   Choose "Add a heading" (or "Add a subheading").
    *   Type your text.
    *   Use the font selection dropdown at the top to choose a bold font (e.g., Montserrat Bold, Bebas Neue, Impact).
    *   Adjust the font size using the number field next to the font selection.  Aim for a size that fills a significant portion of the screen, but still fits within the safe zones.
    *   Change the text color using the color picker.  Consider using a color that contrasts strongly with your background.

2.  **Speech Bubbles:**

    *   Click the "Elements" tab on the left sidebar.
    *   Search for "speech bubble" or "chat bubble".
    *   Choose a graphic that you like.  Free options are available.
    *   Resize and position the speech bubble.
    *   Add text inside the speech bubble using the text tools described above.

3.  **Split Screen Effect:**

    *   Click the "Elements" tab.
    *   Search for "grids".
    *   Choose a grid layout that divides the screen vertically or horizontally (e.g., a two-column or two-row grid).
    *   Drag photos or videos (from the "Photos" or "Videos" tab, or upload your own) into each section of the grid.  You can also use solid colors for each section.

4.  **Icon Placement:**

    *   Click the "Elements" tab.
    *   Search for specific icons (e.g., "arrow", "thumbs up", "bell").
    *   Choose icons that are relevant to your video's message.
    *   Resize and position the icons strategically. Don't overcrowd the scene.

5.  **Background Gradients:**

    *   Click on the background of your page.
    *   Click the "Color" square in the top left.
    *   Select the "Gradient" tab.
    *   Choose a pre-made gradient or create your own using the custom gradient tool.  Gradients add visual interest without being too distracting.

**4. Animations: Bringing Your Video to Life**

1.  **Page Animations (Transitions):**

    *   Hover between two pages in the editor. A "+ Add transition" button will appear. Click it.
    *   A panel will open on the left side.
    *   Choose a transition style (e.g., "Slide", "Dissolve", "Circle Wipe").
    *   Adjust the duration of the transition using the slider.  A short duration (0.3 - 0.5 seconds) is usually best for a fast-paced Short.
    *   Apply the transition to all pages if you want consistent transitions.

2.  **Element Animations:**

    *   Select an element (text, icon, image).
    *   Click the "Animate" button in the top toolbar.
    *   Choose an animation style from the "Element Animations" section.
    *   **Good choices for Shorts:**
        *   **Simple:** "Rise", "Pop", "Tumble"
        *   **Dynamic:** "Breathe", "Wipe", "Pan"
    *   Adjust the speed and intensity of the animation (if available).

3. **Timing Suggestions:**

    *  Keep your scenes short and sweet. A general guideline is 3-5 seconds per scene. Vary the length based on the content.
    *  Use animations to draw attention to key information as it appears on screen.

**5. Adding Audio: Voiceovers and Music**

1.  **Upload Voiceover:**

    *   Click the "Uploads" tab on the left sidebar.
    *   Click the "Audio" tab.
    *   Click the "Upload files" button and select your voiceover audio file.

2.  **Add Audio to Pages:**

    *   Drag the audio file from the "Uploads" tab onto a page.  Canva will automatically place it at the beginning of the page.
    *   To trim the audio for each page, click on the audio track at the bottom of the screen.  Drag the handles on either end of the audio track to shorten it.

3.  **Sync Voice to Pages:**  Listen to your voiceover and adjust the length of each page to match what's being said.  This is crucial for a smooth and engaging video.

4.  **Add Background Music (Optional):**

    *   Search for royalty-free music on sites like YouTube Audio Library, Epidemic Sound, or Artlist.
    *   Upload the music file to Canva (as described above).
    *   Add the music track to your video.
    *   **Important:** Lower the volume of the background music significantly so it doesn't drown out your voiceover. You can adjust audio volume by clicking on the audio track and using the volume slider that appears in the top right.

**6. Export Settings: Getting Your Video Ready to Share**

1.  **Download Your Video:** Click the "Share" button in the top right corner.
