**Overall Goal:** To provide a clear and compelling call to action, driving viewers to the RPI Framework via the link in bio.

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Instagram Reels
**Duration:** 2 seconds

**1. Background:**

*   **Color:** Gradient from `#007BFF` (bright blue - top) to `#6A1B9A` (deep purple - bottom). This creates a dynamic and modern feel.

**2. Main Elements:**

*   **Text Overlay 1:** "Try the" (Font: Open Sans, size: 48pt, Color: #FFFFFF, Position: Top Center - slightly below the top third, animation: Fade in at 0:28)
*   **Text Overlay 2:** "RPI Framework." (Font: Open Sans Bold, size: 60pt, Color: #FFFF00 (bright yellow), Position: Center, animation: Scale up from 90% to 100% at 0:28, then slightly pulse in size between 95% and 100% throughout the scene). This is the main focus.
*   **Text Overlay 3:** "Link in bio!" (Font: Open Sans, size: 48pt, Color: #FFFFFF, Position: Bottom Center - slightly above the bottom third, Animation: Slide up from the bottom at 0:28.5)

*   **GitHub Icon:** (Search "GitHub Icon" in Canva Elements - ideally, find a white one). Size: Small, placed to the right of "Link in bio!". Animation: Small, subtle bounce animation (up/down) throughout the scene starting at 0:28.5, to draw attention.

**3. Layout:**

*   **Top Third:** Contains the RPI Logo and "Try the" text.
*   **Center:** Dominant "RPI Framework." text.
*   **Bottom Third:** "Link in bio!" text and GitHub icon.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    1.  "RPI Framework." (Largest, brightest color, pulsing animation)
    2.  "Link in bio!" (Clear CTA, animated icon)
    3.  RPI Logo (Brand recognition)
    4.  "Try the" (Introduces the CTA)
