# ACT 1: THE HOOK (0-10 minutes)

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Methodology logo + "From Operator to CPO: Inside a Real Product Decision"

### [0:00-1:00] OPENING

**[Walk on stage. Pause. Make eye contact.]**

"On December 4th, 2025, at exactly 12:07 PM, I sat in on a pricing review meeting that changed how I understand product leadership forever.

It wasn't at Google. It wasn't at a unicorn startup. It was at a 30-person food company called Methodology.

And in 118 minutes, I watched a CEO teach his operations manager and culinary director how to think like a Chief Product Officer—not by giving them a framework on a slide, but by making a real decision about whether to launch a new product that could either increase revenue by hundreds of thousands... or accidentally destroy the business.

I'm going to show you that meeting today. Word for word. Decision by decision.

And by the end of this hour, you're going to know exactly what separates someone who *manages products* from someone who *leads them at the executive level*."

**[Pause for 2 seconds]**

## SLIDE 2: "Most CPO Advice Is Useless"
**Visual:** List of generic advice crossed out

### [1:00-3:00] THE PROBLEM WITH CPO CONTENT

"Here's what most content about becoming a CPO tells you:

❌ 'Be strategic'
❌ 'Think about the customer'
❌ 'Use data to make decisions'
❌ 'Communicate cross-functionally'

Cool. HOW?

What does 'being strategic' actually look like when you're staring at a spreadsheet trying to decide if a new product will make you $200,000 or lose you $200,000?

What does 'thinking about the customer' mean when the customer data is incomplete and you have to ship next week?

No one shows you the *actual decision-making process*.

Today, I'm going to."

---

## SLIDE 3: "Who I Am"
**Visual:** Your photo + brief bio

### [3:00-4:00] CREDIBILITY

**[Adapt this to your background]**

"Quick context on me: [Your background—e.g., 'I've spent 8 years in product roles at X, Y, Z companies. I've shipped products to millions of users. And I've made every mistake you can make.']

But today isn't about my career. It's about what I learned by analyzing this single meeting at Methodology—a company that ships fresh meals nationwide.

Because in this meeting, I saw something rare: a founder who thinks like a world-class product executive, teaching his team how to think that way too."

---

## SLIDE 4: "What You'll Learn Today"
**Visual:** Three pillars

### [4:00-5:30] THE PROMISE

"By the end of this talk, you'll understand:

**1. The Six Frameworks CPOs Use**
Not theory. The actual mental models used in that December meeting to make a $250K+ revenue decision.

**2. The Gap Between PM and CPO**
Why being a great product manager doesn't automatically prepare you for the executive level—and what's missing.

**3. Your Development Plan**
The specific skills, exercises, and mindset shifts you need to make in the next 90 days to start thinking like a CPO.

Sound good?

Let's go inside the meeting."

---

## SLIDE 5: "The Company: Methodology"
**Visual:** Methodology product photos, quick stats

### [5:30-7:00] CONTEXT SETTING

"First, you need to understand the business.

**Methodology** is a fresh meal delivery company. Think premium meal prep—chef-designed, nutrient-dense meals shipped to your door.

**The business model:**
- $450 average order value (4-day reset program)
- 66% of revenue comes from nationwide shipping (not local delivery)
- $480 customer acquisition cost
- 50% gross margin target

**The challenge:**
They're profitable, growing, but every product decision matters because:
- High CAC means they *lose money* on first orders
- They need customers to reorder to break even
- Adding the wrong product could cannibalize existing revenue

**The stakes are real.**

Now, let's meet the players."

---

## SLIDE 6: "The Players"
**Visual:** Headshots + roles

### [7:00-9:00] CHARACTERS

"In this meeting, there are three people:

**Stephen Liu** – CEO & Co-founder
Former finance guy. Thinks in unit economics. Runs weekly pricing reviews. This is the person teaching CPO thinking.

**Bridget Daugherty** – Culinary Director
Manages menu design, recipe costing, portion sizes. Deep domain expertise in food, learning product thinking.

**Drew Beyersdorf** – Operations Manager
Runs fulfillment, logistics, and is being groomed for executive product ownership.

**The decision they're making:**

Should they launch a new product line called **'Petite Programs'**—a lower-calorie, lower-cost version of their resets that removes ACV shots and truffle boxes?

Sounds simple, right?

It's not.

And over the next 2 hours, Stephen is going to teach Drew and Bridget how to think about this decision the way a CPO would.

Let me show you how it starts."

---

## SLIDE 7: "The Meeting Begins" (Transcript Excerpt)
**Visual:** Chat bubble format, first exchange

### [9:00-10:00] TRANSITION TO CASE STUDY

"Here's how the meeting opens:

> **Drew:** 'What up, Bridget?'
> **Bridget:** 'Hello.'
> **Drew:** 'How are you?'
> **Bridget:** 'Doing alright. How are you?'
> **Drew:** 'Tugging along. Trying to catch up on emails and meetings and stuff.'

Normal. Casual. Just another Wednesday meeting.

But watch what happens when Stephen joins at minute 32."

**[Pause]**

"Stephen doesn't start with small talk. He starts with a question.

And that question is going to reveal the first framework."

---

# ACT 2: THE PROBLEM (10-25 minutes)

## SLIDE 8: "Stephen's First Question"
**Visual:** Pull quote from transcript

### [10:00-12:00] THE OPENING MOVE

"Stephen asks:

> **Stephen:** 'Drew, do you know what the petite program is?'
> **Drew:** 'Roughly, I would like it explained to me.'

Now, Drew runs operations. He knows the products. But Stephen asks him to explain it anyway.

**Why?**

Because CPOs don't assume. They verify understanding before making decisions.

Bridget explains:

> **Bridget:** 'The petite program is supposed to be calorie-restricted, nonsense-free. It's food, meals, matcha. That's it. No truffles, no shrubs, nothing. Just meals, matcha. Done.'

Okay. Simple product.

But then Stephen asks the *real* question—the one that changes everything."

---

## SLIDE 9: "The Question That Changes Everything"
**Visual:** Pull quote in large text

### [12:00-14:30] HOLISTIC THINKING INTRODUCED

"Stephen doesn't ask:
❌ 'Can we build this?'
❌ 'Will customers want this?'
❌ 'What's the margin?'

He asks:

> **Stephen:** 'Drew, since we sell more of the 4-day reset than any other reset type, should we just do the petite program for this one?'

And then:

> **Stephen:** 'Put yourself into the guest shoes and see all of the different variations. You see 32 things you can go through. What do you think?'

**This is the first framework: Holistic Thinking.**

A product manager thinks: *'Can I ship this feature?'*

A CPO thinks: *'If I ship this, what happens to everything else?'*

Stephen isn't just thinking about the petite program. He's thinking about:
- **Customer experience** – Will 32 options overwhelm people?
- **Cannibalization** – Will this steal sales from existing products?
- **Operations** – Can the team handle more SKU complexity?
- **Positioning** – Does the name communicate the right value?

**This is executive thinking.**

And he's about to teach Drew how to do it."

---

## SLIDE 10: "The CEO's Challenge to Drew"
**Visual:** Full quote, emphasized

### [14:30-17:00] THE TEACHING MOMENT

"At timestamp 39:29, Stephen says something that every aspiring CPO needs to hear:

> **Stephen:** 'Drew, I'm asking you to look at it from a holistic perspective because that's the mindset I'm trying to get you to shift into. Not looking at it just from an ops manager standpoint. Look at it from—you are going to sit alongside Julie and me to make really important decisions for the organization. Pretend Julie and I don't exist. What do you do here?'

**Stop.**

Read that again.

*'Pretend Julie and I don't exist. What do you do here?'*

This is how you develop CPO thinking.

You don't wait until you have the title to think like an executive.

You start thinking like the CEO and co-founder *aren't there*—and you have to make the call.

Drew's immediate reaction?

> **Drew:** 'I personally have no withdrawals or holdback worries. I think you could launch all 16 [variations] and I would be fine.'

And Stephen pushes back:

> **Stephen:** 'I know you would be fine, Drew. I want you to think in the bigger picture of what's most optimal. We don't want to launch this and then pull this off at some point. So is there an optimal way to launch this and even if we want to launch it or not?'

**This is the gap.**

Drew is thinking operationally: *'Can I execute this?'*
Stephen is thinking strategically: *'Should we even do this?'*

That's the difference between a manager and an executive."

---

## SLIDE 11: "Framework #1: Holistic Thinking"
**Visual:** Diagram with 5 connected circles

### [17:00-19:00] FIRST FRAMEWORK EXPLAINED

"So let's codify this.

**Framework #1: Holistic Thinking**

Before making any product decision, a CPO asks:

1. **Customer Impact** – Does this improve or confuse the customer journey?
2. **Financial Impact** – Does this grow revenue or cannibalize it?
3. **Operational Impact** – Can we execute this without breaking things?
4. **Marketing Impact** – Can we communicate this clearly?
5. **Strategic Impact** – Does this align with where we're going long-term?

**In the meeting, Stephen forces the team to walk through the customer onboarding flow.**

They literally pull up the website and click through:
- Program type selection
- Meal schedule selection
- Days of food selection
- Pricing display

And at each step, Stephen asks:

*'If we add a petite program here, what happens to the customer experience?'*

**This is not theoretical.**

He's pressure-testing the decision *before* building anything.

And that's when the second framework emerges."

---

## SLIDE 12: "The Data Stephen Doesn't Have"
**Visual:** List of unknown variables

### [19:00-22:00] DATA-DRIVEN UNCERTAINTY

"Now here's where it gets interesting.

After walking through the customer journey, Stephen says:

> **Stephen:** 'I don't know what I don't know. So I don't want to decide on something where there's an unintended consequence that I didn't see because I was too lazy to go through the thinking.'

And then he lists everything he *doesn't* know:

❓ How many customers choose one-time programs vs. subscriptions?
❓ Of one-time buyers, how many repurchase?
❓ Would a lower-priced option increase conversion or just cannibalize?
❓ How much profit do we actually make per program?
❓ What's the gross margin vs. the dollar profit?

**And then he says something critical:**

> **Stephen:** 'I couldn't tell you today. I don't have enough information to make a decision on this. I still don't know how... I can't map it all in my head yet. I'm just as confused as you are actually in this decision-making process.'

**Wait. The CEO is confused?**

Yes. And that's the point.

**Framework #2: Comfortable with Uncertainty**

A product manager feels pressure to have the answer.
A CPO knows when they *don't* have the answer—and outlines what data they need.

Stephen doesn't fake confidence. He says:

*'Here's what I need to know before I can decide.'*

And then he assigns Drew to pull:
- One-time vs. subscription split for 4-day and 5-day programs
- Repurchase rate for one-time buyers
- Gross margin breakdown by program type

**This is executive maturity.**

Knowing when you don't know. And being systematic about finding out."

---

## SLIDE 13: "The Unit Economics Bomb"
**Visual:** Math breakdown on screen

### [22:00-25:00] THE FINANCIAL REALITY

"And then, Stephen drops the unit economics bomb.

He asks Drew to calculate:

> **Stephen:** 'If someone buys a one-time program, how much do we lose?'

Here's the math:

```
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $480
4-Day Reset Price: $450
Gross Margin: 50%
Gross Profit: $225

First Order Deficit: $480 - $225 = -$255
```

**If a customer only buys once, Methodology loses $255.**

Read that again.

Every single first-time customer is *unprofitable*.

The business only works if customers reorder.

And now, they're considering launching a *cheaper* product.

If that cheaper product:
- Generates only $175 profit per order (instead of $225)
- The deficit grows to -$305 per customer

**So the question becomes:**

*Will this cheaper option convert enough NEW customers to offset the lower profit per transaction?*

*Or will it just cannibalize existing customers who would've paid more?*

**This is CPO-level thinking.**

Stephen isn't asking *'Will this sell?'*

He's asking: *'Will this be profitable at scale, or will it quietly kill us?'*

And that's when the third framework shows up."

**[End Act 2]**

# ACT 3: THE FRAMEWORKS (25-40 minutes)

## SLIDE 14: "Framework #3: Margin % vs. Dollar Profit"
**Visual:** Two columns comparing margin % vs. dollar profit

### [25:00-28:30] THE ADVANCED MOVE

"Okay, this next part is where Stephen teaches something most product leaders miss.

Bridget has built a pricing calculator. It shows:
- Cost of goods (meals, matcha, ACV shots, truffle boxes)
- Shipping cost
- Gross margin as a **percentage** (targeting 50%)

Standard stuff, right?

But then Stephen says:

> **Stephen:** 'I want you to calculate the dollar profit margin—literally the dollars of profit per program today. Without any regard to the percentage of margin. For the petite programs, but keep the same dollar margin.'

**Drew asks: 'Why?'**

And Stephen explains:

> **Stephen:** 'If we don't want this thing to disrupt our business at all, then even if someone swaps from one thing to another, we're making the same dollar amount from that person. Because dollar amount is what I can actually hold true.'

**Let me break this down.**

**Scenario 1: Optimize for Margin %**
- Original 4-day reset: $450 revenue, 50% margin = $225 profit
- Petite 4-day reset: $350 revenue, 55% margin = $192.50 profit
- **Result:** Higher margin %, but you lose $32.50 per order

**Scenario 2: Optimize for Dollar Profit**
- Original 4-day reset: $450 revenue, 50% margin = $225 profit
- Petite 4-day reset: $375 revenue, 60% margin = $225 profit
- **Result:** Same profit per customer, revenue-neutral if they switch

**Framework #3: Dollar Profit > Margin %**

Stephen is saying:

*'I don't care if the margin percentage changes. I care that we make the same absolute dollars.'*

**Why?**

Because if customers are going to choose the petite program anyway, you want to make sure you're not leaving money on the table.

Most product leaders optimize for margin percentage.
**CPOs optimize for business outcomes.**

And that's the difference."

---

## SLIDE 15: "Framework #4: Variable Isolation"
**Visual:** Checklist of variables

### [28:30-32:00] THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

"Now Stephen does something methodical.

He goes through the customer onboarding flow and lists every single variable:

> **Stephen:** 'Let's just be disciplined about going through each one without passing them over with your eyes.'

**The variables:**
1. Program type (Signature, Top Mom, Transformation Tribe)
2. Program schedule (One-time vs. Weekly subscription)
3. Which meals (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner, Lunch/Dinner, etc.)
4. Meal portion size (Standard, Petite)
5. Diet (Meat & Seafood, Vegetarian, etc.)
6. Days of food (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days)

And then he asks:

*'What might you be curious about?'*

**This is Framework #4: Variable Isolation.**

Before making a decision, a CPO:
- Lists all variables
- Isolates the ones that matter most
- Asks: *'What do we need to know about each one?'*

In this case, Stephen zeroes in on:

**Program schedule** – One-time vs. subscription

Why?

Because if most people are choosing one-time programs, they're unprofitable customers.

If most people are choosing subscriptions, the business works.

**And no one in the room knows which it is.**

So Stephen assigns Drew to pull the data:

*'I want to know, for 4-day and 5-day programs, how many are one-time vs. subscription.'*

**This is systematic thinking.**

Don't assume. Isolate the variables. Get the data."

---

## SLIDE 16: "Framework #5: Cannibalization Modeling"
**Visual:** Venn diagram of customer segments

### [32:00-35:30] THE FEAR

"And now we get to the fear.

Stephen says:

> **Stephen:** 'If 20% of people end up choosing this meals-only program, and it's $50 less, did we just step on our own foot and take in less revenue when they would have bought anyway?'

**This is cannibalization.**

Every new product can steal revenue from existing products.

**The question is:**

Is the new product bringing in *new* customers (good)?
Or is it just converting existing customers to a cheaper option (bad)?

**Framework #5: Cannibalization Modeling**

Before launching, a CPO models:

```
Net Impact = (New customers × Revenue) - (Cannibalized customers × Lost revenue)
```

**Example:**

Let's say the petite program:
- Converts 50 new customers per month who wouldn't have bought otherwise
  - Revenue: 50 × $375 = $18,750

- But 30 existing customers downgrade from $450 to $375
  - Lost revenue: 30 × $75 = -$2,250

**Net impact:** +$16,500 per month = Good launch

**But what if it's:**
- Converts 20 new customers: 20 × $375 = $7,500
- 80 existing customers downgrade: 80 × $75 = -$6,000

**Net impact:** +$1,500 per month = Not worth the complexity

**The problem?**

You don't know until you launch.

So Stephen says:

*'We need more data. I can't make this decision yet.'*

And that's okay.

**A CPO's job isn't to make fast decisions.**
**It's to make right decisions.**"

---

## SLIDE 17: "Framework #6: Positioning & Naming"
**Visual:** Before/After naming comparison

### [35:30-38:30] THE COMMUNICATION GAP

"Okay, last framework.

Stephen identifies a problem with the product name.

He says:

> **Stephen:** 'Julie's original two intentions for launching this: One is lower calorie. Two is people are not having to pay for things they don't want. If we call it a petite program, you only communicate one of those value props, not both.'

**The gap:**

- **Intention 1:** Lower calorie ✅ 'Petite' communicates this
- **Intention 2:** No unwanted items ❌ 'Petite' doesn't communicate this

**Framework #6: Name = Position**

The product name must communicate the value proposition.

If your product solves two problems, the name should hint at both—or you need two separate products.

**Stephen's feedback:**

> **Stephen:** 'Julie, you might want to rethink renaming this as not a petite program, or find a way to communicate both.'

And then he suggests:

*'Put this thinking into ChatGPT. Ask for 3 alternative names that communicate both value props. Return to Julie with options, not just agreement.'*

**This is executive coaching.**

Stephen isn't telling them what to name it.

He's teaching them *how to think about naming*.

**A product manager names based on features.**
**A CPO names based on customer jobs-to-be-done.**

And that's the sixth framework."

---

## SLIDE 18: "The Six CPO Frameworks"
**Visual:** Summary list with icons

### [38:30-40:00] RECAP

"Let's recap what we just learned from this meeting.

**The Six Frameworks CPOs Use:**

1. **Holistic Thinking** – Consider customer, financial, operational, marketing, and strategic impact
2. **Comfortable with Uncertainty** – Know when you don't know; outline what data you need
3. **Dollar Profit > Margin %** – Optimize for business outcomes, not vanity metrics
4. **Variable Isolation** – List all variables, isolate what matters, get data systematically
5. **Cannibalization Modeling** – Model whether new products steal or grow revenue
6. **Name = Position** – Product names must communicate value props clearly

**These aren't taught in product management courses.**

These are learned by working with executive leaders who think this way—or by studying meetings like this one.

And now you have them.

But here's the question:

*How do you actually become this person?*"

**[End Act 3]**

# ACT 4: THE PATH (40-50 minutes)

## SLIDE 19: "The Gap Between PM and CPO"
**Visual:** Two-column comparison

### [40:00-42:30] THE TRANSITION

"Let's talk about the gap.

**What makes a great Product Manager:**
- Shipping features on time
- Managing backlogs and roadmaps
- Working with engineers and designers
- Talking to customers
- Writing PRDs

**What makes a Chief Product Officer:**
- Making $100K+ revenue decisions
- Owning P&L responsibility
- Thinking 3-5 years ahead
- Managing a portfolio of products
- Leading cross-functional leaders (not ICs)

**The gap is:**

**1. Financial Fluency**
PMs think in features. CPOs think in CAC, LTV, payback period, contribution margin.

**2. Strategic Altitude**
PMs optimize the product. CPOs optimize the business.

**3. Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**
PMs execute on decisions. CPOs make the decisions when data is incomplete.

**4. Cross-Functional Leadership**
PMs coordinate with functions. CPOs lead functions.

**The good news?**

You can start developing these skills *right now*.

You don't need the title.

Let me show you how."

---

## SLIDE 20: "Your 90-Day CPO Development Plan"
**Visual:** Timeline with 3 phases

### [42:30-47:00] THE ACTIONABLE PLAN

"Here's your plan to start thinking like a CPO in the next 90 days.

---

## **WEEK 1-4: Financial Fluency**

**Task 1: Master Unit Economics**

Build a spreadsheet for your product that includes:
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) by channel
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value) by cohort
- **Payback period** (How long to break even on a customer?)
- **Contribution margin** (Revenue - variable costs)
- **Dollar profit per transaction** (Not just %)

**Why this matters:**

In the Methodology meeting, Stephen knew immediately:
- CAC is $480
- Gross profit on first order is $225
- Deficit is -$255

You need to know these numbers for your product cold.

**Exercise:**

Open your analytics dashboard right now. Can you answer:
- What's your CAC?
- What's your LTV?
- What's your gross margin in dollars (not %)?

If you can't, you're not ready for CPO-level conversations.

---

**Task 2: Build a Pricing Model**

Create a Google Sheet with:
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) per product
- Gross margin % and dollar profit
- Scenario modeling: If we drop price 10%, what happens to volume and profit?

**Why this matters:**

Stephen asked Bridget to calculate: *'If we keep dollar profit flat, what do we charge?'*

Most PMs can't answer that question. CPOs can.

---

## **WEEK 5-8: Strategic Thinking**

**Task 3: Practice Holistic Thinking**

For every product decision you're facing, write down:
1. **Customer Impact** – Will this improve or confuse the experience?
2. **Financial Impact** – Will this grow or cannibalize revenue?
3. **Operational Impact** – Can we execute without breaking things?
4. **Marketing Impact** – Can we communicate this clearly?
5. **Strategic Impact** – Does this align with our 3-year vision?

**Why this matters:**

This is what Stephen did when evaluating the petite program.

**Exercise:**

Pick a feature you shipped recently. Go back and answer these 5 questions.

Did you consider all of them before shipping? If not, what would you have changed?

---

**Task 4: Map Your Customer Journey**

Literally screenshot every step of your product onboarding/purchase flow.

Print them out. Tape them to a wall.

Ask yourself:
- Where do users drop off?
- Where does pricing get confusing?
- Where would adding a new option help vs. hurt?

**Why this matters:**

Stephen walked through the Methodology onboarding screen-by-screen to see where the petite program would fit.

You need to know your customer journey this intimately.

---

## **WEEK 9-12: Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**

**Task 5: Practice 'I Don't Know'**

In your next product meeting, practice saying:

*'I don't have enough information to make this decision. Here's what I need to know: [list data points].'*

**Why this matters:**

Stephen said: *'I'm just as confused as you are. I can't map it all in my head yet.'*

CPOs aren't afraid to admit uncertainty. They're disciplined about outlining what they need to decide confidently.

---

**Task 6: Build a Cannibalization Model**

For your next product launch, model:

```
Best case: [New customers] × [Revenue] - [Cannibalized customers] × [Lost revenue]
Base case: [Realistic numbers]
Worst case: [Conservative numbers]
```

Present all three scenarios to your team.

**Why this matters:**

This is what Stephen did with the petite program. He said:

*'Will this convert new customers, or will it just steal from existing ones?'*

CPOs scenario-plan before launching.

---

**End of 90 Days: You now think differently.**

You're not a CPO yet. But you're thinking like one.

And that's what gets you the seat at the table."

---

## SLIDE 21: "How to Study for CPO"
**Visual:** Resource list

### [47:00-50:00] THE STUDY PLAN

"Okay, so beyond the 90-day plan, how do you actually study for this role?

**1. Learn from Real Decisions**

Find transcripts, case studies, or recordings of actual product decisions.

Not Medium articles. Not frameworks. Real decisions.

This Methodology meeting is one example. Find more like it.

**2. Shadow Executive Product Leaders**

If you're at a company with a CPO/VP Product:
- Ask to sit in on pricing reviews
- Ask to see their financial models
- Ask: *'How did you decide X?'*

If you're not at a company like that:
- Find a mentor who's done the role
- Pay for 1-hour consulting sessions with fractional CPOs
- Join communities where CPOs hang out (Lenny's, Reforge, etc.)

**3. Build Your Own 'Pricing Review' Habit**

Every week, review:
- Revenue by product/SKU
- Gross margin by product/SKU
- Top-selling vs. bottom-selling products
- Customer feedback on pricing

This is what Stephen does every Wednesday at Methodology.

If you're not a founder, you might not own this.

But you can build the habit of *looking at this data* and forming opinions.

**4. Practice Executive Communication**

Learn to give options, not just recommendations.

Instead of:
❌ 'We should launch the petite program.'

Say:
✅ 'Here are three options:
Option 1: Launch petite program for all reset types—highest complexity, highest potential revenue
Option 2: Launch petite program for 4-day only—test demand, lower risk
Option 3: Don't launch—focus on increasing conversion on existing products

Here's the data I'd need to decide between them: [list]'

**This is how CPOs talk.**

---

**5. Study Unit Economics Obsessively**

Read:
- *The Cold Start Problem* by Andrew Chen (network effects)
- *Monetizing Innovation* by Madhavan Ramanujam (pricing psychology)
- *Unit Economics* by SaaS Capital (financial modeling)

Watch:
- Lenny's Podcast (interviews with CPOs)
- Lennybot tutorials on pricing
- Financial modeling courses on Maven/Reforge

**6. Get Comfortable with Spreadsheets**

You don't need to be a data scientist.

But you need to be fluent in:
- Google Sheets / Excel
- Basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, IF statements)
- Pivot tables
- Scenario modeling

If you can't build a financial model in 20 minutes, you're not ready.

---

**The Bottom Line:**

Becoming a CPO isn't about promotions.

It's about thinking differently.

And you can start today."

**Visual:** Meeting outcome

### [50:00-52:00] RESOLUTION

"So what happened in the Methodology meeting?

Did they launch the petite program?

**No. Not yet.**

At the end of the meeting, Stephen said:

*'I don't have enough information to make a decision on this. I still need data on one-time vs. subscription split, repurchase rates, and whether we can keep dollar profit flat.'*

He assigned Drew to pull the data.

He asked Bridget to recalculate pricing with dollar profit held constant.

And he flagged to Julie (the co-founder) that the product name might not communicate both value props.

**The meeting didn't end with a decision.**

**It ended with a plan to get the information needed to make the right decision.**

And that's the point.

**CPO thinking isn't about having all the answers.**

**It's about knowing what questions to ask.**

And being disciplined enough not to ship until you know.

That's leadership."

## SLIDE 23: "The Key Takeaways"
**Visual:** Three core lessons

### [52:00-54:00] THE SYNTHESIS

"Let me leave you with three things:

**1. You Don't Need the Title to Think Like a CPO**

Stephen is teaching Drew and Bridget to think this way before they have executive titles.

You can start today.

**2. Frameworks > Intuition**

Stephen didn't guess. He used systematic frameworks:
- Holistic thinking
- Variable isolation
- Cannibalization modeling
- Dollar profit optimization

Learn these. Apply them.

**3. The Best CPOs Teach**

Stephen didn't just make the decision himself.

He taught Drew and Bridget *how to think* about the decision.

That's what great leaders do.

And when you become a CPO, that's what you'll do too."

## SLIDE 25: "Thank You"
**Visual:** Contact info + resources

### [56:00-57:00] CLOSING

"Thank you for your time today.

I hope this meeting inside Methodology showed you what CPO thinking actually looks like—not in theory, but in practice.

If you take nothing else from this talk, remember:

**The gap between PM and CPO isn't talent.**

**It's frameworks.**

**And frameworks can be learned.**

Let's take questions."

## [57:00-60:00] Q&A

**[Open floor for questions]**

**Suggested Q&A prompts if audience is quiet:**

- "What's the #1 skill gap you see in product managers trying to move to CPO?"
- "How do you get access to financial data if you're not in a leadership role yet?"
- "What should I do if my company doesn't have a CPO to learn from?"
