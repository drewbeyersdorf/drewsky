# Tonight: Prep for Tomorrow's Recording

## Quick Prep (Do Tonight - 30 minutes)

### ✅ Content Review
- [ ] Read through `PROMPT_ENGINEERING_TUTORIAL.md` once
- [ ] Bookmark 3-4 example prompts to use in ChatGPT tomorrow
- [ ] Decide: Will you create slides or just screen share with notes?

### ✅ Equipment Check
- [ ] Find your camera/webcam
- [ ] Locate microphone (or plan to use laptop mic as backup)
- [ ] Charge everything that needs charging
- [ ] Test screen recording software (OBS/QuickTime/etc)

### ✅ Space Setup
- [ ] Choose recording location (quiet room)
- [ ] Clear desk/background (what will be visible)
- [ ] Test lighting (face near window = good natural light)
- [ ] Put "Recording - Do Not Disturb" sign on door

### ✅ Quick Tech Test
- [ ] Open ChatGPT or Claude in browser
- [ ] Do 30-second test recording (audio + video)
- [ ] Play back - can you hear yourself clearly?
- [ ] Adjust mic closer if needed

## Tomorrow Morning Checklist

### Before Recording:
- [ ] **Good sleep tonight** (you need energy!)
- [ ] Review script one more time over coffee
- [ ] Turn on Do Not Disturb mode (all devices)
- [ ] Close all browser tabs except ChatGPT/Claude
- [ ] Have water nearby
- [ ] Take 3 deep breaths
- [ ] Hit record!

## If You're Feeling Overwhelmed

**Minimum Viable Version:**
Skip the fancy slides. Just do this:
1. Face cam recording yourself
2. Screen share ChatGPT as you demo
3. Use the script as talking points (don't memorize)
4. Record in 3-5 minute chunks (easier to edit)

**Remember:** Done is better than perfect. Ship it, get feedback, improve on video #2.

## Worst Case Scenario

If tomorrow doesn't work out:
- **Plan B:** Just start uploading your 41 short videos (1 per day = content for 6 weeks)
- **Plan C:** Record the tutorial in 3-5 minute sections over several days
- **Plan D:** Do an even simpler version - just talk through the cheatsheet on camera

**You've already done the hard work.** Tomorrow is just hitting record and being yourself! 🚀
