## THE SIX CPO FRAMEWORKS

### Framework #1: Holistic Thinking
**What it is:** Before making any product decision, consider impact across all functions.

**How to apply:**
For every product decision, answer:
1. **Customer Impact** – Does this improve or confuse the customer journey?
2. **Financial Impact** – Does this grow revenue or cannibalize it?
3. **Operational Impact** – Can we execute this without breaking things?
4. **Marketing Impact** – Can we communicate this clearly?
5. **Strategic Impact** – Does this align with our 3-year vision?

**Example from Methodology:**
Stephen didn't just ask "Can we launch petite programs?"
He asked: "Will 32 product options overwhelm customers? Will this cannibalize our top-selling resets?"

---

### Framework #2: Comfortable with Uncertainty
**What it is:** Know when you don't have enough information—and outline what data you need.

**How to apply:**
Instead of guessing, say:
*"I don't have enough information to decide. Here's what I need: [list specific data points]."*

**Example from Methodology:**
Stephen said: *"I'm just as confused as you are. I can't map it all in my head yet."*
Then he assigned Drew to pull: one-time vs. subscription split, repurchase rates, and margin by program type.

**Action:** In your next meeting, practice saying "I don't know" and listing what data you'd need.

---

### Framework #3: Dollar Profit > Margin %
**What it is:** Optimize for absolute profit dollars, not margin percentages.

**How to apply:**
When pricing products, calculate:
- **Margin % optimization:** Can lead to lower total profit
- **Dollar profit optimization:** Keeps revenue stable even if product mix changes

**Example from Methodology:**
- Original reset: $450, 50% margin = $225 profit
- Petite reset (margin-optimized): $350, 55% margin = $192.50 profit ❌ (-$32.50)
- Petite reset (dollar-optimized): $375, 60% margin = $225 profit ✅ (revenue-neutral)

**Action:** Build a pricing model that shows both margin % and dollar profit. Optimize for the latter.

---

### Framework #4: Variable Isolation
**What it is:** List all variables in a decision, then isolate the ones that matter most.

**How to apply:**
1. List all variables (customer segments, pricing tiers, features, etc.)
2. Ask: "Which one, if changed, would have the biggest impact?"
3. Get data on that variable first

**Example from Methodology:**
Stephen identified 6 variables in the customer journey:
- Program type
- Program schedule (one-time vs. subscription) ← KEY
- Which meals
- Meal portion size
- Diet type
- Days of food

He focused on #2 (subscription split) because it determined profitability.

**Action:** For your next decision, write down all variables. Circle the top 3 that matter most.

---

### Framework #5: Cannibalization Modeling
**What it is:** Model whether a new product will bring in new customers or just steal from existing ones.

**How to apply:**
```
Net Impact = (New customers × Revenue) - (Cannibalized customers × Lost revenue)
```

**Example scenarios:**

**Scenario A (Good launch):**
- 50 new customers × $375 = $18,750
- 30 cannibalized × $75 lost = -$2,250
- **Net: +$16,500/month**

**Scenario B (Bad launch):**
- 20 new customers × $375 = $7,500
- 80 cannibalized × $75 lost = -$6,000
- **Net: +$1,500/month** (not worth the complexity)

**Action:** Before launching your next product, model best case, base case, and worst case.

---

### Framework #6: Name = Position
**What it is:** Product names must communicate your value proposition clearly.

**How to apply:**
Ask: "Does this name communicate the job-to-be-done?"

**Example from Methodology:**
The "petite program" had two intentions:
1. Lower calorie ✅ "Petite" communicates this
2. No unwanted items (ACV, truffles) ❌ "Petite" doesn't communicate this

**Stephen's feedback:** "If we call it a petite program, you only communicate one value prop, not both."

**Action:** For your product names, list the jobs-to-be-done. Does the name hint at all of them?

## THE 90-DAY CPO DEVELOPMENT PLAN

### MONTH 1: Financial Fluency

**Week 1-2: Master Unit Economics**
Build a spreadsheet for your product with:
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) by channel
- LTV (Lifetime Value) by cohort
- Payback period
- Contribution margin
- Dollar profit per transaction

**Exercise:** Can you answer these questions cold?
- What's your CAC?
- What's your LTV?
- How long to break even on a customer?
- What's your gross margin in dollars (not %)?

**Week 3-4: Build a Pricing Model**
Create a Google Sheet with:
- COGS per product
- Gross margin % and dollar profit
- Scenario modeling: If we drop price 10%, what happens to volume and profit?

**Template:** Download at gomethodology.com/cpo

---

### MONTH 2: Strategic Thinking

**Week 5-6: Practice Holistic Thinking**
For every product decision, write down the 5 impacts:
1. Customer
2. Financial
3. Operational
4. Marketing
5. Strategic

**Exercise:** Pick a feature you recently shipped. Go back and answer these 5 questions. What would you have changed?

**Week 7-8: Map Your Customer Journey**
Screenshot every step of your product onboarding/purchase flow.
Print them. Tape to a wall.

Ask:
- Where do users drop off?
- Where does pricing get confusing?
- Where would adding a new option help vs. hurt?

**Tool:** Use Hotjar, FullStory, or Mixpanel to see actual user flows.

---

### MONTH 3: Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

**Week 9-10: Practice 'I Don't Know'**
In your next product meeting, say:
*"I don't have enough information to decide. Here's what I need: [list data]."*

**Exercise:** List 3 product decisions you're facing. For each, write:
- What do I know?
- What don't I know?
- What data would I need to decide confidently?

**Week 11-12: Build a Cannibalization Model**
For your next product launch, model:

```
Best case:
- [New customers] × [Revenue per customer]
- [Cannibalized customers] × [Lost revenue]
= Net impact

Base case: [Realistic numbers]
Worst case: [Conservative numbers]
```

Present all three scenarios to your team.

## THE GAP BETWEEN PM AND CPO

| **Great Product Manager** | **Chief Product Officer** |
|---|---|
| Ships features on time | Makes $100K+ revenue decisions |
| Manages backlogs | Owns P&L responsibility |
| Works with engineers/designers | Leads cross-functional leaders |
| Talks to customers | Defines 3-5 year product strategy |
| Writes PRDs | Presents to the board |

**The gap is:**
1. **Financial fluency** – CAC, LTV, payback period, contribution margin
2. **Strategic altitude** – Business outcomes, not just product features
3. **Decision-making under uncertainty** – Making calls with incomplete data
4. **Cross-functional leadership** – Leading directors/VPs, not ICs

**Good news:** You can start developing these now.

## HOW TO STUDY FOR CPO

### 1. Learn from Real Decisions
- Find transcripts, case studies, recordings of actual product decisions
- Not theory. Real decisions with real stakes.
- **Example:** The Methodology meeting at gomethodology.com/cpo

### 2. Shadow Executive Product Leaders
- Ask to sit in on pricing reviews, strategy sessions
- Ask: "How did you decide X?"
- If you don't have access, hire a fractional CPO for 1-hour consulting sessions

### 3. Build Your Own 'Pricing Review' Habit
Every week, review:
- Revenue by product/SKU
- Gross margin by product/SKU
- Top-selling vs. bottom-selling products
- Customer feedback on pricing

### 4. Practice Executive Communication
Instead of:
❌ "We should launch the petite program."

Say:
✅ "Here are three options:
- Option 1: Launch for all reset types (high complexity, high revenue)
- Option 2: Launch for 4-day only (test, lower risk)
- Option 3: Don't launch (focus on conversion)

Here's the data I need to decide: [list]"

### 5. Study Unit Economics Obsessively
**Books:**
- *The Cold Start Problem* by Andrew Chen
- *Monetizing Innovation* by Madhavan Ramanujam
- *Unit Economics* by SaaS Capital

**Podcasts:**
- Lenny's Podcast
- Masters of Scale
- Acquired (for business model deep-dives)

**Courses:**
- Reforge (Product Strategy, Monetization)
- Maven (Product Leadership courses)

### 6. Get Comfortable with Spreadsheets
You don't need to be a data scientist, but you need:
- Google Sheets / Excel fluency
- Basic formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, IF statements)
- Pivot tables
- Scenario modeling

**If you can't build a financial model in 20 minutes, you're not ready.**
