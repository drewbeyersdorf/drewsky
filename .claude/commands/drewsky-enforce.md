# drewsky Protocol Enforcement

Load and enforce the complete drewsky Framework protocol for rigorous AI collaboration.

## Task

Read the full drewsky protocol from `docs/core/ENFORCED_drewsky_PROTOCOL.md` and actively apply all rules to this session.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Core Protocol**
   - Load `docs/core/ENFORCED_drewsky_PROTOCOL.md`
   - Internalize all 10 drewsky rules
   - Understand each methodology's purpose

2. **Summarize Key Rules**
   Present the core rules in this format:

   ```
   🔒 drewsky Protocol Enforcement Active

   Core Methodologies:

   1. TCREI Validation (Google AI)
      - Task: What exactly needs to be done?
      - Context: Why is this needed?
      - Reference: Any examples or patterns?
      - Evaluation: How to measure success?
      - Input: What files/data to examine first?

   2. MAKER Decomposition (AI Engineering)
      - Manageable: Steps small enough for one session
      - Atomic: Single, indivisible purpose
      - Knowable: Clear completion criteria
      - Executable: Concrete actions, not vague
      - Reviewable: Verifiable outputs

   3. Chain of Verification (Meta AI - 23% hallucination reduction)
      - Generate baseline response
      - Plan verification questions
      - Answer independently from sources
      - Generate verified final response

   4. Dual-Loop Planning (Microsoft Magentic-One)
      - Outer Loop: Strategic goals, milestones, risks
      - Inner Loop: Tactical actions, progress tracking
      - Coordination: Facts vs guesses, decision points

   5. Reflective Learning (Stanford/SambaNova)
      - Extract patterns from experience
      - Identify helpful vs harmful actions
      - Build reusable skills library

   [... continue with remaining rules ...]
   ```

3. **Research Backing**
   Mention the academic/industry research for each:
   - Meta AI: CoVe paper on hallucination reduction
   - Microsoft: Magentic-One multi-agent system
   - Stanford/SambaNova: Agentic Context Engine (ACE)
   - Google DeepMind: AlphaEvolve prompt optimization

4. **Enforcement Confirmation**
   State clearly: "These methodologies are now actively enforced for this session. All responses will apply appropriate framework techniques."

5. **Available Commands**
   Remind user of methodology commands:
   - `/tcrei` - Apply TCREI to current task
   - `/maker` - Decompose current task
   - `/verify` - Verify current claims
   - `/plan` - Apply dual-loop planning

## Expected Output

After running this command, you should:
- Display comprehensive summary of all drewsky rules
- Highlight research backing for each methodology
- Confirm active enforcement
- List available commands for applying methodologies
- End with: **"✅ Full drewsky Protocol Enforced - All methodologies active"**

## When to Use

Use this command when:
- Starting complex, critical work
- Mid-session reminder needed
- Switching to high-stakes task
- Need full framework awareness
- Teaching/demonstrating drewsky to others

## What This Enables

**Without Enforcement:**
- Ad-hoc approaches
- Inconsistent methodology application
- Missed opportunities for verification
- Reactive problem-solving

**With Enforcement:**
- Systematic application of proven methodologies
- Proactive use of TCREI, MAKER, CoVe, Dual-Loop
- Consistent high-quality collaboration
- Research-backed decision making
