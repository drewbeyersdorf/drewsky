# RPI Framework - Command Reference

Quick reference guide for applying RPI Framework methodology in your Claude Code sessions.

## Core Methodology Commands

### `/tcrei`
**Apply TCREI Validation** - Structure your request with Task, Context, Reference, Evaluation, Input validation. Eliminates ambiguity and improves output quality.

*Use when:* Starting any task, clarifying requirements, reducing back-and-forth

### `/maker`
**Apply MAKER Decomposition** - Break complex tasks into Manageable, Atomic, Knowable, Executable, Reviewable steps. Prevents overwhelm and tracks progress.

*Use when:* Facing complex multi-step tasks, need clear roadmap, want to prevent scope creep

### `/verify`
**Apply Chain of Verification (CoVe)** - Meta AI's 4-step fact-checking process. Reduces hallucinations by 23% through systematic verification.

*Use when:* Answering questions about code, making recommendations, uncertain about claims

### `/plan`
**Apply Dual-Loop Planning** - Microsoft's Magentic-One strategic + tactical planning. Separates high-level vision from concrete execution.

*Use when:* Large refactors, migrations, architectural changes, anything taking >30min

## Framework Management

### `/rpi-init`
**Initialize RPI Framework** - Load and activate the complete RPI protocol for current session. Sets enhanced AI collaboration mode.

*Use when:* Starting a new session, beginning important work

### `/rpi-enforce`
**Load Full Protocol** - Display complete RPI rules with research backing. Reminds Claude of all framework guidelines.

*Use when:* Mid-session refresher needed, complex work requires full protocol

### `/rpi-status`
**Framework Status Check** - Verify installation, check files, validate setup.

*Use when:* Troubleshooting, verifying setup, checking configuration

## Quick Decision Guide

**Simple bug fix?** → Use `/tcrei` to clarify scope
**Complex feature?** → Use `/maker` to break it down
**Need verification?** → Use `/verify` for fact-checking
**Major refactor?** → Use `/plan` for dual-loop planning
**Starting session?** → Use `/rpi-init` to activate framework

## Research Backing

- **Meta AI**: Chain of Verification (23% hallucination reduction)
- **Microsoft**: Magentic-One dual-loop planning (stall detection)
- **Stanford/SambaNova**: Reflective learning (skill extraction)
- **Google DeepMind**: AlphaEvolve (prompt optimization)

## Framework Philosophy

RPI Framework combines research-backed methodologies to:
1. **Reduce ambiguity** through structured prompting (TCREI)
2. **Manage complexity** through systematic decomposition (MAKER)
3. **Ensure accuracy** through verification (CoVe)
4. **Maintain direction** through dual-loop planning (Strategic + Tactical)

For complete documentation, see `README.md` or use `/rpi-enforce`.
